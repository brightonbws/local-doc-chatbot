Certainly. To become a data engineer, you'll need to develop a range of skills across several areas. Here are some key topics and technologies you should consider learning:

1. Programming Languages:
   - Python (essential)
   - SQL (essential)
   - Java or Scala (often used in big data technologies)

2. Database Systems:
   - Relational databases (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL)
   - NoSQL databases (e.g., MongoDB, Cassandra)
   - Data warehousing solutions (e.g., Snowflake, Amazon Redshift)

3. Big Data Technologies:
   - Apache Hadoop ecosystem
   - Apache Spark
   - Apache Kafka for stream processing

4. Cloud Platforms:
   - Amazon Web Services (AWS)
   - Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
   - Microsoft Azure

5. Data Processing and ETL Tools:
   - Apache Airflow
   - Apache NiFi
   - Talend or Informatica

6. Version Control:
   - Git

7. Data Modeling and Design:
   - Dimensional modeling
   - Data warehouse architecture

8. Data Governance and Quality:
   - Data quality best practices
   - Data lineage
   - Data security and privacy

9. Machine Learning Basics:
   - Understanding ML pipelines
   - Feature engineering

10. DevOps and DataOps:
    - Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)
    - Docker and Kubernetes
    - Infrastructure as Code (e.g., Terraform)

11. Business Intelligence Tools:
    - Familiarity with tools like Tableau or Power BI

12. Soft Skills:
    - Problem-solving
    - Communication
    - Collaboration

To get started, I'd recommend focusing on Python, SQL, and a cloud platform like AWS.
Then, gradually expand your skills to cover more areas.
Practical projects and certifications can also be very helpful in your learning journey.
